#Web Culture

This section explores the world of online culture. This is not just the way online culture reflects our real world culture, but the ways in which online interactions have given rise to a whole set of memes, concepts, historical events, and organizations that have come to define part of what it means to live a significant amount of our lives online.

It's crucial to understand the culture we are creating online. Parts of it may be wonderful, and parts of it may reflect the darkest parts of our offline culture, but all of it is relevant to the work we do. We cannot build for an environment we do not understand. We are well-served to map the landscape in order to provide a clear context for our efforts.
