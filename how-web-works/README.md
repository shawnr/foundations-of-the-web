# How the Web Works
In this chapter we will take a high-level look at how the web works. We will explore how the Internet connects computers at a technical level -- how information is actually sent around the network. We will discuss the concept of servers and clients, which is fundamental to how networks operate. We will also take a look at how domains and URLs work, and how we can read them in order to gain an understanding about how the website is operating. Finally, we will review network governance and who sets the rules for the Internet and the World Wide Web.
