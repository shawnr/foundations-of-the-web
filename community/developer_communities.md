#Developer Communities

<p>Just like other groups online, developers and people who create websites tend to gather in different areas online. There are a few major sources of information about the web development industry that are probably on most people's radars (or in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS feed readers</a>). This page lists some of the different locations online that you should add to your regular browsing list. Keeping an eye on these sites, and participating in activities with colleagues and peers will help you stay on top of the ever-changing field of web development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember: The rate of change for web technology is not going to slow down, so we all need to work in time for reading, learning and connecting with peers in order to stay current as we work on our own projects.</p>

<h2>Web Development on Social Media</h2>
<p>Many, many individuals in the web industry are on Twiter, Facebook, LinkedIn, G+, Meetup, etc. It is good to follow your friends and peers, but also other noteworthy developers. It's especially useful to identify noteworthy developers working with technology similar to what you are using. This allows you to absorb changes immediately relevant to your projects much more quickly.</p>
<p>There are many lists available online to help you find people to follow. In general, searching for "twitter list &lt;topic&gt;" will reveal all kinds of suggestions for any given topic. Here is a link to get you started: <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=web%20development%20industry%20lists%20twitter&amp;safe=on">web industry twitter lists</a>.
